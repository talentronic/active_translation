# WARNING KLAXON WARNING

🚨 ActiveTranslation is pre-1.0 🚨

This means there may be unhandled edge cases and undiscovered bugs. Please don't use it in production without rigorous QA.

If you find a bug or problem, please report it. If you have an idea for a new feature, please suggest it.


# ActiveTranslation

ActiveTranslation is a Rails plugin that lets you easily translate ActiveRecord models. With a single line added to that model, you can declare which columns, which locales, and what constraints to allow or prevent translation.


## How does this differ from internationalization (`I18n`)?

I18n is a great solution for elements of your app that are static, nearly static, aren't database-driven, or otherwise can be controlled or constrained in some fashion.

It can't help you if you have something that's user-supplied. It can't help you if you need translations available without a deploy, on demand.

Even in instances where it can help you, there are times when having hundreds of lines of YAML can become tedious or difficult to maintain.

Consider something like product categories: you might allow product managers to create them as needed. If you want them translated, you now need to communicate this to someone who can update the translation files. It's not difficult or tedious at first.

Instead, what if you just add a single line to your `Category` model. Now product managers can create new categories with whimsical abandon, and your international customers don't have to wait for engineering or a third party to copy/paste into a `.yml` file.


## Installation

Add the gem to your gemfile:

```ruby
gem "active_translation"
```

And then bundle:

```bash
bundle
```

Run the installer to add a migration and initializer:

```ruby
rails generate active_translation:install
```

Migrate your primary database:

```ruby
rails db:migrate
```

You will need to restart your rails server and your ActiveJob adapter process (if separate) if it was running when you installed and migrated.


## Configuration

The first step after installation is to configure your Google credentials. ActiveTranslation uses the Google Translate API in the background for translation. This is a bit more than just an API key.

The general idea is:

1. Create a project at https://console.cloud.google.com
1. In “APIs & Services” > “Library” look for “Cloud Translation API”
1. Create a Service Account and download the JSON key file
1. Ensure billing is enabled, and all the other prerequisites that Google requires
1. Extract the necessary data from that JSON file and plug those values into `config/initializers/active_translation.rb` by setting the appropriate environment variables

Feel free to change the names of the environment variables, or to alter that initializer to assign those keys however you like. At Talentronic, we have an `APIConnection` model we use for stuff like that so we grab the credentials from there and assign them.

You could also use something like `dotenv-rails` and create a `.env` file in your various environments.

Or you could use the OS to define them, such as in an `/etc/environment` file.

If you're using Kamal, you probably already have a way to manage secrets and add them to env variables - that works, too.

Obvious reminder: whatever method you use, just make sure it's not committed to any repository, even once. If you do, make sure you get new credentials and expire/delete the credentials that got committed.

That's the hard part!


## Usage

To any ActiveRecord model, add `translates` with a list of columns that should be translated, a list of locales and any constraints.

Simplest form:

```ruby
translates :content, into: %i[es fr de]
```

### Into

The `into` argument can be an array of locales, a symbol that matches a method that returns an array of locales, or a Proc that returns an array of locales.

So you could do:

```ruby
translates :content, into: :method_that_returns_locales
```

or

```ruby
translates :content, into: -> { I18n.available_locales - [ I18n.default_locale ] }
```

> `it` is a recent Ruby syntactical grain of sugar. It's the same as `_1` which lets you skip the `{ |arg| arg == :stuff }` repetition

#### Into All

Because translating a model into all the locales your app may define is so common, you can pass `:all` to the `into` argument to achieve the same result as passing `-> { I18n.available_locales - [ I18n.default_locale ] }`.

This means you cannot pass in your own method called "all" as a symbol, of course.

### If Constraints

An `if` constraint will prevent translating if it returns `false`.

If you have a boolean column like `published`, you might do:

```ruby
translates :content, into: %i[es fr de], if: :published?
```

Or you can define your own method that returns a boolean:

```ruby
translates :content, into: %i[es fr de], if: :record_should_be_translated?
```

Or you can use a Proc:

```ruby
translates :content, into: %i[es fr de], if: -> { content.length > 10 }
```

### Unless Constraints

These work exactly the same as the `if` constraint, but the logic is flipped. If the constraint returns `true` then no translating will take place.

### Constraint Compliance

If your record is updated such that either an `if` or `unless` constraint is toggled, this will trigger the addition _or removal_ of translation data. The idea here is that the constraint controls whether a translation should _exist_, not whether a translation should be performed.

This means if you use a constraint that frequently changes value, you will be paying for half of all change events.

This is intentional. Translations are regenerated any time one of the translated attributes changes. But what about something like a `Post` that shouldn't be translated until it's published? There's no sense in translating it dozens of times as it's edited, but clicking the “publish” button doesn't update the translatable attributes.

So ActiveTranslation watches for the constraint to change so that when the `Post` is published, the translation is performed with no extra effort.

Likewise, if the constraint changes the other way, translations are removed since ActiveTranslation will no longer be keeping those translations up-to-date. Better to have no translation than a completely wrong one.

### Manual Attributes

Sometimes you want to translate an attribute, but it's not something Google Translate or an LLM can handle on their own. For instance, at Talentronic, we have names of businesses that operate in airports. These names have trademarked names that might look like common words, but aren't. These names also have the airport included which can confuse the LLM or API when it's mixed in with the business name.

So we need manual translation attributes:

```ruby
translates :content, manual: :name, into: %i[es fr]
```

Manual attributes have a special setter in the form of `#{locale}_#{attribute_name}`. So in this example, we get `fr_name=` and `es_name=`.

These attributes never trigger retranslation, and are never checked against the original text - it's entirely up to you to maintain them. However, it does get stored alongside all the other translations, keeping your database tidy and your translation code consistent.

### The Show

Once you have added the `translates` directive with your columns, locales, and constraints and your models have been translated to at least one locale, it's time to actually use them.

If you set:

```ruby
translates :content, manual: :name, into: %i[es fr]
```

on a `Post` model, then you can simply call `.content` and it will use the current locale from Rails `I18n`.

If you need the value for a locale other than the current, you can specify the locale explicitly:

```ruby
@post.content(locale: :fr)
```

If the post has an `fr_translation`, then that will be shown. If no `fr_translation` exists, it will show the post's untranslated `content`.

In this way, you'll never have missing values, but you will have the default language version instead of the translated version.

The same goes for manual translations:

```ruby
@post.name
```

returns the translated name for the current locale if it exists, or the untranslated `name` if it does.

```ruby
@post.name(locale: :es)
```

Regardless of the current locale, it will return the `:es` translated value for the `name` attribute, or the untranslated `name` if the `es_translation` doesn't exist.


### Extras

There are a few niceties provided to make ActiveTranslation as flexible as possible.

Ideal world: you won't need them.
Real world: you might need them.

#### Translate on Demand

There may be times when things get hosed. You might need or want to translate the automatic columns manually. You can do this in three ways:

##### translate_if_needed

By calling `translate_if_needed`, you can run the same checks that would occur on update. This is similar to calling `touch`, but it doesn't update the `updated_at` timestamp

This will schedule the translation as a background job

##### translate!

By calling `translate!`, you skip all checks for whether a translation is outdated or missing and generate a new translation even if it's already extant and accurate.

This will schedule the translation as a background job.

##### translate_now!(locales)

By calling `translate_now!` and optionally passing 1 or more locales, you skip all checks for whether a translation is outdated or missing and generate a new translation for the passed locales even if they're already extant and accurate.

The default value for locales is `translatable_locales`, so if you don't pass anything, it will translate into all locales defined for that model.

This method does **not** schedule the job, and instead immediately performs the translation, blocking until the translations for all locales are complete.

#### Introspection

The goal of ActiveTranslation is to make translations as automatic and invisible as possible. However, there may be times when you need to know the state of translations on a model instance.

##### translation_checksum

By calling `translation_checksum`, you can return the checksum used on a record to determine whether translations are outdated.

##### translations_outdated?

By calling `translations_outdated?`, you can get `true` if any translation has a checksum that no longer matches the source (otherwise you get `false`).

This has limited value, but is provided in case you need to handle situations in which models change without triggering callbacks.

> NOTE: `translations_outdated?` will _always_ return `false` if the conditions you passed (`if` & `unless`) are not met

##### outdated_translations

By calling `outdated_translations`, you can get an array of all `translations` that are outdated.

This has limited value, but is provided in case you need to handle situations in which models change without triggering callbacks.

##### translations_missing?

By calling `translations_missing?`, you can get `true` if any translations are missing. This is a complex question, and is `false` unless:

- any automatic translation attributes are not blank
- any automatic translation attributes are missing an entry for any locale (in addition to not being blank)

So if you have `translates :title, manual: :name, into: :all` and your app supports `:fr` and `:es`, you will get `true` if:

- the `title` has been translated into `:es`, but not `:fr`
- no translations exist at all
- the `name` has been translated into both `:es` and `:fr` but `title` hasn't been translated
- the `name` has been translated into both `:es` and `:fr` but `title` has been translated into only one locale

and you will get `false` if:

- translations conditions are not met, regardless of the presence or absence of any translations
- the `title` column is blank (`nil` or empty string)
- the `title` column has been fully translated but the `name` column has not been (manual attributes are ignored)
- the `title` column has been fully translated, but the `title` column has changed since the translation in a way that doesn't trigger callbacks

This has limited value, but is provided in case you need to handle situations in which models change without triggering callbacks.

##### fully_translated?(auto_or_manual_or_all)

By calling `fully_translated?` with no arguments, you can get `true` if all attributes are translated. This ignores manual attributes by default.

There are some special symbols you can pass to change the scope of "fully." If you pass `:all` or `:include_manual`, then you will get `true` only if all automatic _and_ manual attributes have a translation.

If you pass `:manual` or `:manual_only`, then you will get `true` only if all manual attributes have a translation, disregarding automatic attributes.

Passing `:auto` or `:auto_only` is the same as passing no argument.

Passing an invalid argument raises an error.

> NOTE: `fully_translated?` will _always_ return `true` if the conditions you passed (`if` & `unless`) are not met

##### translatable_locales

By calling `translatable_locales`, you will get an array of locales for which the object will be translated. This has no bearing on whether any translations exist, or any conditions for translations to be performed.

> NOTES: This is only defined on instances of a model, not the model itself, since the `into` argument allows more than just an Array literal.

##### translation_config

You can call `translation_config` on a model or instance to see what you've set up for translations. You'll see something like:

```ruby
> Page.translation_config
=> {attributes: [:title, :heading, :subhead, :content], manual_attributes: [], locales: :all, unless: nil, if: :published?}

> Category.translation_config
=> {attributes: [:name, :short_name],
 manual_attributes: [],
 locales: #<Proc:0x000000012231a2b8 /path/to/projects/active_translation/app/models/category.rb:67 (lambda)>,
 unless: nil,
 if: nil}

> Widget.translation_config
=> {attributes: [:title, :headline, :ad_html],
 manual_attributes: [],
 locales: [:es, :fr],
 unless: #<Proc:0x00000001228fea58 /path/to/projects/active_translation/app/models/widget.rb:42 (lambda)>,
 if: nil}

> Widget.last.translation_config
=> {attributes: [:title, :headline, :ad_html],
 manual_attributes: [],
 locales: [:es, :fr],
 unless: #<Proc:0x00000001228fea58 /path/to/projects/active_translation/app/models/widget.rb:42 (lambda)>,
 if: nil}

> Account.translation_config
=> {attributes: [:profile_html], manual_attributes: ["name"], locales: :method_that_returns_locales, unless: nil, if: nil}
```

#### Disclaimer

ActiveTranslation doesn't check the accuracy of translations in any way. It assumes that the response from Google is always perfect. If you are translating sensitive content where accuracy is critical in a legal or existential sense, you must handle translation auditing separately.

So if you use the for an EULA, make it a manual attribute or don't use ActiveTranslation for it at all.

ActiveTranslation doesn't redact any content. It assumes you would never send PII or financial data for translation. So... please don't.


## Testing

Ideally, you do not need to write any tests for translations or how they behave, since ActiveTranslation tests itself.

However, perhaps you bolt on additional functionality to tests, or translations are critical to your application, or you simply want to ensure you're expecting the correct results from using the gem. In that case, ActiveTranslation provides some simple testing features.

All translations skip the call to Google in the test environment, and return a simple modification of that content. For example, translating into the `:fr` locale in a test environment would behave as so:

- Input: "auto translated content from ActiveRecord object"
- Output: "[fr] auto translated content from ActiveRecord object"
